  <h2>Instructions</h2>

  <ol>

  <li class="Instructions1">Beat the eggs: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. 
  You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.</li> <br>

  <li class="Instructions1">Heat the pan: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.</li><br>

  <li class="Instructions1">Cook the omelette: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure 
  the eggs evenly coat the surface. </li><br>

  <li class="Instructions1">Add fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the 
  middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.</li><br>

  <li class="Instructions1">Fold and serve: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the 
  fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.</li><br>

  <li class="Instructions1">Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.</li><br>
</ol>
